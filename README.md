# AVR MCU implementation of pomodoro time controller

The current version is for the cheap but old __at90s2313__ or __attiny2313__ (_in at90s2313 mode_).  

* Freq. = 16MHz
* 2 LEDs on PB0 and PB1 (Anode to pin)
* 1 button from PD2 to GND

If you have Proteus, then you can run the attached simulation.

You can change the program to suit your needs or to another controller. _Please share your code._  
I'll be glad to contact you for any of your questions.
